NAME
    Net::MQTT::Message - Perl module to represent MQTT messages

VERSION
    version 1.111930

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::MQTT::Constants;
      use Net::MQTT::Message;
      use IO::Socket::INET;
      my $socket = IO::Socket::INET->new(PeerAddr => '127.0.0.1:1883');
      my $mqtt = Net::MQTT::Message->new(message_type => MQTT_CONNECT);
      print $socket $mqtt->bytes;

      my $tcp_payload = pack 'H*', '300d000774657374696e6774657374';
      $mqtt = Net::MQTT::Message->new_from_bytes($tcp_payload);
      print 'Received: ', $mqtt->string, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This module encapsulates a single MQTT message. It uses subclasses to
    represent specific message types.

METHODS
  "new( %parameters )"
    Constructs an Net::MQTT::Message object based on the given parameters.
    The common parameter keys are:

    "message_type"
        The message type field of the MQTT message. This should be an
        integer between 0 and 15 inclusive. The module Net::MQTT::Constants
        provides constants that can be used for this value. This parameter
        is required.

    "dup"
        The duplicate flag field of the MQTT message. This should be either
        1 or 0. The default is 0.

    "qos"
        The QoS field of the MQTT message. This should be an integer between
        0 and 3 inclusive. The default is as specified in the spec or 0 ("at
        most once") otherwise. The module Net::MQTT::Constants provides
        constants that can be used for this value.

    "retain"
        The retain flag field of the MQTT message. This should be either 1
        or 0. The default is 0.

    The remaining keys are dependent on the specific message type. The
    documentation for the subclasses for each message type list methods with
    the same name as the required keys.

  "new_from_bytes( $packed_bytes, [ $splice ] )"
    Attempts to constructs an Net::MQTT::Message object based on the given
    packed byte string. If there are insufficient bytes, then undef is
    returned. If the splice parameter is provided and true, then the
    processed bytes are removed from the scalar referenced by the
    $packed_bytes parameter.

  "message_type()"
    Returns the message type field of the MQTT message. The module
    Net::MQTT::Constants provides a function, "message_type_string", that
    can be used to convert this value to a human readable string.

  "dup()"
    The duplicate flag field of the MQTT message.

  "qos()"
    The QoS field of the MQTT message. The module Net::MQTT::Constants
    provides a function, "qos_string", that can be used to convert this
    value to a human readable string.

  "retain()"
    The retain field of the MQTT message.

  "remaining()"
    This contains a packed string of bytes with any of the payload of the
    MQTT message that was not parsed by these modules. This should not be
    required for packets that strictly follow the standard.

  "string([ $prefix ])"
    Returns a summary of the message as a string suitable for logging. If
    provided, each line will be prefixed by the optional prefix.

  "bytes()"
    Returns the bytes of the message suitable for writing to a socket.
